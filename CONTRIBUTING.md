# How to contribute to zSnout.com

## Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching existing Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much **relevant information** as possible, and a **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting, make sure all code has been formatted with Prettier using our [prettierrc](/prettierrc.json). zSnout uses this to make sure all code follows the same style.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- If you want to add a new feature, open a Discussion. Once the discussion has over 10 thumbs up reactions, you may open an Issue or Pull Request about the feature.
- In the discussion, mention reasons why you want the feature. Others can reply with additional reasons why THEY want the feature to be added.
- Some example reasons (you need to elaborate on these) include accessibility, ease of use, seperating pages, consistent theming, etc.
