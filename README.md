# zSnout.com in NodeJS

This is the source code for a beta version of [zsnout.com](https://zsnout.com/) made using NodeJS.

# Our Dev Stack

zSnout uses [Fastify](https://fastify.io/) as the web framework, [EJS](https://ejs.co/) as a templating library, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org/) as front-end libraries, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a type checking library, and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS extension.

We do not provide a compiled version of the TypeScript and Sass, so you will need to run `npm run build` once you download this repository.
